        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="about__text">
          The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) is a large infrared telescope with an
          approximately 6.5 meter primary mirror. Webb successfully launched from ESA's spaceport in French Guiana on
          December 25, 2021 07:20am EST ( 2021-12-25 12:20 GMT/UTC) .
          <br>
          <br>
          Webb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study
          every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the
          formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar
          System.
          <br>
          <br>
          Webb was formerly known as the "Next Generation Space Telescope" (NGST); it was renamed in Sept. 2002 after a
          former NASA administrator, James Webb.
          <br>
          <br>
          Webb is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space
          Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center managed the development effort. The main industrial partner
          is Northrop Grumman; the Space Telescope Science Institute operates Webb after launch.
          <br>
          <br>
          Several innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a primary mirror made of 18
          separate segments that unfold and adjust to shape after launch. The mirrors are made of ultra-lightweight
          beryllium. Webb's biggest feature is a tennis court sized five-layer sunshield that attenuates heat from the
          Sun more than a million times. The telescope's four instruments - cameras and spectrometers - have detectors
          that are able to record extremely faint signals. One instrument (NIRSpec) has programmable microshutters,
          which enable observation up to 100 objects simultaneously. Webb also has a cryocooler for cooling the
          mid-infrared detectors of another instrument (MIRI) to a very cold 7 K so they can work.
